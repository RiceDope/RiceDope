Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## About Me
Im a 19 year old student studying at the University Of Kent. This is my personal page for code that I work on in my spare time. Anything related to my course won't be worked on publicly here.  

I've been interested in coding for about 8-9 years now and I've used multiple languages in this time. My interest started in year 7 when I was introduced to python and this was my main language for the btter part of my coding career.

### Laguages I've Used
- Python
- Lua
- PHP
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Java

Some of these I know a lot better than others and most of them at a relatively surface level. Some like Python I've not touched in the better part of three years and languages like lua haven't been used since a project I worked on in sixth form.

My current main language would be Java as it is used in most modules in my course and probably my prefered language.

Most of what I work on here is for fun and isn't meant to be taken too seriously but if you have any suggestions then please let me know im always open to improve my coding style and effeciency.

## Projects
A list of projects current and past that I have worked on. Anything marked as a past project may still recieve updates as I may still have ideas of things to add but they are for a future day as the code is at a place I am currently happy with.

### Current
- Binary Search Tree. As the name suggests its a BST. Im currently working on Post order traversal and renaming some functions.

### Past
- Multi Clipboard. This was a simple project but also my first using the GitHub copilot. It allows the user to save multiple clipboards using a command line application. I used applications to convert into an executable as well as using another application to convert back from a .jar to a java file as the java file became corrupted.

- Merge Sort. Once again this is quite a self explanatory project and did not take too long. But it takes in an ArrayList of integers and sorts them using the merge sort algorithm.

## Future projects
My plan is to work through creating basic but fundamental algorithms that will give me a better base when working on larger projects.

Additionally I will be working on smaller projects that are more for my personal enjoyment such as the multi clipboard project.
