## About Me
I'm a 21 year old Computer Science student about to graduate from the University of Kent. On this page you can see a selection of personal/university/work projects that I have had the pleasure to work on. Below is an explanation of each of my important projects.

## Projects

- Callisto:
    This was a project that I worked on as part of my final year project and the UoK. It is a collections library built out of three classes: Set, Map and Sequence. The Sequence features two concrete strategies that can be swapped out at runtime. It helped me to learn about benchmarking (JMH), testing (JUnit) as well as graph producing using Python and Matplotlib.
- Multi-Clipboard:
    This was a small project that I worked out a couple of years ago. It allows the user to save and load different clipboards from the CMD application. This project helped me learn how launch4j works for packaging applications.
- Environment-Sensor:
    This was another project that I undertook at the UoK, this was the first project where I gained experience using c++ and arduino. The sensor sends basic data over MQTT to a Server which is implemented in Python, this processes data and can be interacted with. There is also a simple GUI which allows the user to graph their sensors and view the raw data. The design of each sensor unit allows for multiple different arduino sensor units to be setup and work independently.
- linked-list-utilities:
    This is a set of utility classes alongside actual implementations of Linked lists. The idea of the project is that linked lists can appear anywhere and a universal set of operations are generally required, they may all have different names but through using java reflections the user can specify their get next term method name regardless of what it is. This is still a WIP and has lot's that needs doing before I can class it as finished.
