## About Me
I'm a 21 year old Computer Science student about to graduate from the University of Kent. On this page you can see a selection of personal/university/work projects that I have had the pleasure to work on. Below is an explanation of each of my important projects.

## Projects

- Callisto:
    This was a project that I worked on as part of my final year project and the UoK. It is a collections library built out of three classes: Set, Map and Sequence. The Sequence features two concrete strategies that can be swapped out at runtime. It helped me to learn about benchmarking (JMH), testing (JUnit) as well as graph producing using Python and Matplotlib.
- Multi-Clipboard:
    This was a small project that I worked out a couple of years ago. It allows the user to save and load different clipboards from the CMD application. This project helped me learn how launch4j works for packaging applications.
